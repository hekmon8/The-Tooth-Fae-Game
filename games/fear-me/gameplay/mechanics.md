# Fear Me Game Mechanics

Understanding Fear Me's core mechanics is essential for navigating the psychological horror visual novel successfully. This guide explains the affection system, dialogue mechanics, and ending triggers that shape your experience in this horror dating sim.

## The Affection System

The affection system is the foundation of Fear Me's gameplay. Every dialogue choice you make affects your relationship status with the three available romantic interests: Jeff the Killer, one male character, and one female character. The game tracks separate affection points for each character, allowing you to focus your efforts on a specific romance route.

### How Affection Works

Affection points increase or decrease based on dialogue selections throughout the game. Positive choices that align with a character's personality and preferences earn affection, while inappropriate or offensive responses may reduce it. The game provides subtle narrative cues about character reactions, helping you understand which responses are working.

### Affection Thresholds

Different endings activate at specific affection levels:

- **High Affection (Romance Endings)**: Require consistent positive interactions and commitment to a single character
- **Medium Affection (Mixed Endings)**: Balanced relationship that may lead to ambiguous conclusions
- **Low Affection (Survival Endings)**: Focus on self-preservation rather than building romantic connections
- **Negative Affection (Bad Endings)**: Result from antagonizing characters or making dangerous choices

### Managing Multiple Routes

Since Fear Me features three romance options, you must commit to a specific character early in your playthrough. Making choices that please one love interest might displease another, so divided attention can lock you out of optimal endings. Use separate playthroughs to explore each character's unique route.

## Dialogue Choice Mechanics

### Reading Context Clues

The narrative often telegraphs preferred responses through character dialogue and descriptions. Pay attention to:

- **Character personality traits** revealed through earlier conversations
- **Emotional state descriptions** that hint at what they need to hear
- **Topic interests** that characters express enthusiasm about
- **Body language cues** in narrative descriptions

### Choice Consequences

Every dialogue selection has consequences that ripple through the story:

- **Immediate reactions**: Characters respond directly to your choices
- **Affection changes**: Points increase or decrease based on appropriateness
- **Branch unlocking**: Certain paths only open at specific affection thresholds
- **Ending determination**: Your cumulative choices determine which conclusions become available

### The Easy Mode System

Easy Mode adds helpful indicators to dialogue choices:

- **Affection Indicators**: Shows which options earn relationship points
- **Danger Warnings**: Alerts you to potentially harmful decisions
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays your current standing with each character

This accessibility feature is valuable for first-time players learning the game's logic and expectations.

## Ending System Mechanics

Fear Me's 9 endings are determined by a combination of affection levels and key story decisions. Understanding how endings trigger helps you target specific conclusions efficiently.

### Ending Categories

**Survival Endings**: Prioritize escape and self-preservation over romance. These typically require cautious dialogue choices and may involve lower affection thresholds.

**Romance Endings**: Explore deeper connections with characters. These demand high affection levels and commitment to a single romance route throughout the game.

**Secret Endings**: Unlock through specific choice combinations that may not be immediately obvious. These often require experimentation and thinking outside conventional visual novel patterns.
