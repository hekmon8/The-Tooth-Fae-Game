## How to Play

### Quick Start

1. **Visit the game online**: [Play The Tooth Fae on PlayTheToothFae.com](https://playthetoothfae.com/games/tooth-fae)
2. **Enable fullscreen mode** for maximum immersion
3. **Turn on sound** - audio cues are essential for gameplay
4. **Follow the four cardinal rules** (see below)
5. **Collect teeth** while maintaining absolute stealth

### The Four Cardinal Rules

Master these rules to succeed in your tooth-collecting mission:

#### 🔹 Rule 1: Preparation is Required
> *"Pulling teeth requires preparation, otherwise a thing may die."*

Never rush the extraction process. Complete all preparation steps before attempting to extract teeth, or your target will die and the mission fails.

#### 🔹 Rule 2: Watch for the Bleeding Signal
> *"A tooth that bleeds is ripe for plucking."*

Wait for the visual bleeding indicator before extraction. This critical signal tells you the tooth is ready. Attempting extraction too early results in failure.

#### 🔹 Rule 3: Manage Your Time
> *"Don't dally. Even such a thing as a fright might be too much for them."*

Balance speed with caution. These creatures are fragile and can die from stress or fright. Be efficient once preparation is complete.

#### 🔹 Rule 4: Absolute Stealth
> *"**YOU MUST NEVER BE SEEN.**"*

Detection means instant game over. Stay hidden at all times, use environmental cover, and monitor target awareness levels constantly.

## Tips & Strategies

### For Beginners

**Start Slow**: Take time to learn the mechanics and rules. Failures are part of the learning process - each attempt teaches valuable lessons.

**Master Stealth First**: Before worrying about speed, focus on staying hidden. Watch target behavior patterns and plan your approach carefully.

**Use Sound**: Always play with audio enabled. Sound cues provide critical information about target awareness and game states.

**Wait for Bleeding**: The bleeding indicator is your green light. Train your eyes to spot it immediately and extract without hesitation.

### Intermediate Techniques

**Plan Your Route**: Study the town layout and group nearby targets to minimize travel time between extractions.

**Timing Perfection**: Learn the exact preparation duration through practice. Develop muscle memory for recognizing the bleeding signal instantly.

**Risk Assessment**: Not all situations are equal. Know when to retreat and try a different approach rather than forcing a bad scenario.

### Advanced Strategies

**Speed Running**: Optimize collection order, minimize preparation time, and perfect extraction execution for fastest completion times.

**Perfect Runs**: Challenge yourself with zero failed extractions and no detection incidents - requires master-level skill and concentration.

**Pattern Mastery**: Memorize target behavior patterns and predict their states to anticipate optimal extraction windows.
