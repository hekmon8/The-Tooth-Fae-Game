<summary>What are the system requirements for The Tooth Fae?</summary>

The Tooth Fae has minimal system requirements thanks to its efficient pixel art design. For the browser version, you need any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) with HTML5 and JavaScript enabled. The game runs smoothly on most computers from the last 5 years.

For the Windows download version (24 MB), you need Windows 7 or later, a modern dual-core processor, 2 GB RAM minimum, and any GPU with basic 2D acceleration. The game requires about 100 MB of storage space. Both keyboard/mouse and controller inputs are fully supported.

Safari users on MacOS should disable low power mode to prevent performance throttling. [Learn more about technical specifications](technical-specs.md) for detailed requirements.

<summary>Can I save my progress in The Tooth Fae?</summary>

Progress persistence varies depending on the version and how you play. The browser version has limited save functionality - your collection progress displays on the town screen during your current session, but may not persist when you close the browser.

**Critical Warning**: Never use the browser back button while on the town screen, as this will erase all your collection progress. Always use in-game navigation to move between screens. The Windows download version may offer better progress persistence. For best results, plan to complete your collection goals in single sessions.

## Gameplay Questions

<details>
<summary>What are the four cardinal rules I must follow?</summary>

The four cardinal rules are essential to successful tooth collection:

**Rule 1**: Pulling teeth requires preparation, otherwise a thing may die. You must complete the preparation phase before attempting extraction.

**Rule 2**: A tooth that bleeds is ripe for plucking. Wait for the visual bleeding indicator before extracting.

**Rule 3**: Don't dally. Even such a thing as a fright might be too much for them. Manage your time efficiently without causing target stress.

**Rule 4**: **YOU MUST NEVER BE SEEN.** Absolute stealth is required - detection means instant failure.

[Master these rules](../gameplay/how-to-play.md) through practice to become an expert tooth collector.

<details>
<summary>How do I know when to extract a tooth?</summary>

Wait for the bleeding indicator to appear after completing the preparation phase. This visual cue is unmistakable - a red effect appears around the target's mouth area, often accompanied by a sound effect. Extracting before this signal appears will result in target death and mission failure.

The preparation phase must be completed first. You'll see visual progress indicators showing preparation status. Only when the bleeding appears should you execute the extraction. Timing is critical - extract immediately when ready, but never before the signal. [Learn extraction mechanics](../gameplay/mechanics.md) for detailed information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do I keep getting detected?</summary>

Detection happens when targets see you, which results in instant mission failure. Common causes include approaching too quickly without observing target behavior, moving through target sight lines without cover, ignoring target awareness indicators (yellow/red states), and failing to use environmental cover effectively.

Improve your stealth by moving in short, controlled bursts, stopping frequently to observe target states, using shadows and cover consistently, approaching from target blind spots, and maintaining patience even under time pressure.

## Technical Issues

<details>
<summary>The game is running slowly in my browser. How can I fix this?</summary>

Browser performance issues usually have simple solutions. First, try switching to Chrome or Firefox if you're using Safari or another browser - these provide the best performance. Enable fullscreen mode by pressing F11 or using the game's fullscreen option.

If you're on Safari/MacOS, disable low power mode which throttles performance. Close unnecessary browser tabs and background applications to free up system resources. Clear your browser cache and restart the browser. If problems persist, try the Windows download version for native performance.

For persistent issues, [check technical specifications](technical-specs.md) to verify your system meets minimum requirements.

<details>
<summary>My controller isn't working. What should I do?</summary>

The Tooth Fae supports Xbox controllers, PlayStation controllers, generic gamepads, and joysticks. If your controller isn't responding, first ensure it's properly connected before launching the game. Install any necessary drivers for your specific controller model.

Verify the browser has focus by clicking on the game window. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the controller. Check the game settings menu for control configuration options. If your specific controller isn't recognized, try using it in generic controller mode. As a fallback, keyboard and mouse controls work perfectly for all gameplay.

[Learn about all control options](../gameplay/controls.md) including customization settings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I lost all my progress! What happened?</summary>

The most common cause of progress loss is using the browser back button on the town screen. This is a known limitation that clears all collection data. Always use in-game navigation instead of browser controls.

Progress may also not persist between browser sessions depending on your browser's cookie and local storage settings. For the most reliable experience, complete your collection goals in single play sessions. Take mental or written notes of your progress if you must take breaks. The Windows download version may offer better progress persistence than the browser version.

<summary>Is The Tooth Fae suitable for all ages?</summary>

The Tooth Fae is a psychological horror game with a creepy atmosphere and unsettling concept. While it uses pixel art graphics rather than realistic visuals, the horror elements and tooth collection theme may be disturbing for younger players.

The game contains no graphic violence, gore, or inappropriate language. However, the psychological tension, stealth horror atmosphere, and premise of extracting teeth from sleeping creatures create an experience best suited for mature players comfortable with horror themes. Parents should preview the game before allowing children to play.
