## Control Tips for Optimal Play

**Movement Precision**: Use short, controlled movements rather than holding directions continuously. This provides better stealth control and reduces detection risk.

**Input Consistency**: Stick with one control scheme to build muscle memory. Switching between keyboard and controller can disrupt your timing and execution.

**Sensitivity Settings**: Adjust mouse or stick sensitivity to match your playstyle. Lower sensitivity provides more precise control for stealth, while higher sensitivity enables quicker reactions.

**Practice in Safe Areas**: Test control configurations in the town screen or early areas before attempting difficult extractions.

## Common Control Issues

### Input Not Responding

Check that your controller is properly connected and recognized by the game. Verify the browser has focus for the web version. Try switching input methods to isolate the problem. Reconfigure controls in settings if issues persist.

### Controller Not Detected

Ensure drivers are installed for your specific controller. Try connecting before launching the game. Check USB port connections and cable integrity. Generic controller mode may work if specific drivers fail.

### Keyboard/Mouse Lag

Close unnecessary browser tabs to free up resources. Disable low power mode on Safari/MacOS systems. Try fullscreen mode for better performance. Switch to the Windows download version if browser performance is poor.

The responsive control system in The Tooth Fae ensures precise stealth gameplay regardless of your input method. Take time to customize settings to your preferences and practice the fundamentals for the best horror experience.
