# Game Mechanics - The Tooth Fae

## Core Gameplay Systems

The Tooth Fae builds tension through interlocking systems that create a challenging stealth horror experience. [Master game mechanics](https://playthetoothfae.com/games/tooth-fae#mechanics) to become an efficient tooth collector while maintaining absolute stealth.

## Stealth System

### Absolute Stealth Requirement

Detection equals instant failure in The Tooth Fae. You must never be seen by targets at any point during your collection missions. This unforgiving mechanic creates constant tension and forces careful planning.

Environmental awareness is critical for success. Study target behavior patterns before approaching, identify safe routes with adequate cover, and monitor target attention levels continuously. Stay in shadows when possible and approach from blind spots.

### Detection Mechanics

Targets have vision cones and awareness states that determine detection risk. Line-of-sight detection is instant when you enter a target's field of view. Distance affects detection speed - closer proximity increases risk. Movement speed influences how quickly targets notice you.

Visual indicators show target awareness levels. Green states indicate safety, yellow warns of suspicion, and red means imminent detection. Audio cues accompany awareness changes, signaling when to freeze or retreat.

## Tooth Extraction Process

### Preparation Phase Requirements

[Play The Tooth Fae online](https://playthetoothfae.com/games/tooth-fae) to experience the unique extraction mechanics that define the gameplay. Before extracting any tooth, you must complete a preparation ritual. Skipping preparation results in target death and mission failure.

The preparation process involves approaching the sleeping target, initiating the extraction sequence, and monitoring progress indicators. Visual feedback shows preparation completion percentage. Audio cues signal important preparation milestones.

### Bleeding Indicator System

The bleeding indicator is your signal that a tooth is ready for extraction. This visual cue appears only after proper preparation is complete. Extracting before bleeding appears causes failure. Immediate extraction upon seeing blood ensures success.

The indicator is unmistakable once you learn to recognize it. A red visual effect appears around the target's mouth area. The effect pulses or glows to draw attention. Sound effects accompany the visual indicator for additional confirmation.

### Extraction Timing

Perfect timing balances preparation completion with target stress levels. Extract immediately when bleeding appears - hesitation increases failure risk. Rushed extraction before preparation kills the target. Delayed extraction after preparation causes stress-induced death.

Experienced players develop muscle memory for extraction timing. The window for successful extraction is generous but not infinite. Practice builds the instinct for perfect timing. [Learn how to play](https://playthetoothfae.com/games/tooth-fae#how-to-play) to master this crucial mechanic.

## Time Pressure System

### Fragile Target Management

Targets are described as "fragile things" that can die from excessive stress. Time limits create pressure without explicit countdown timers. The longer you linger, the higher the risk of target death from fright. Efficient execution is as important as stealth.

### Balancing Speed and Caution

Move deliberately but purposefully during missions. Rushing increases detection risk and extraction errors. Excessive caution wastes time and stresses targets. The optimal approach finds the sweet spot between speed and safety.

Expert players minimize wasted movement and plan efficient routes. They execute extractions in minimal time without sacrificing stealth. Decision-making improves with practice and pattern recognition.

## Collection Management

### Town Screen Interface

The town screen serves as your collection hub and mission selector. View all collected teeth and track progress toward completion. Select next target locations from available options. Review collection statistics and achievements.

**Critical Warning**: The back button clears all collection progress. Use only in-game navigation to move between screens. This limitation adds strategic weight to your collection planning.

### Progress Tracking

Collection progress shows how many teeth you've successfully extracted. Multiple targets exist across different locations. Each successful extraction adds one tooth to your collection. Failed attempts yield nothing and require retry.

Some implementations track attempts, failures, and perfect extractions. Completion percentage motivates full collection goals. Progress may not persist between browser sessions depending on version.

### Target Variety

Different locations present unique challenges and target types. Early targets offer easier stealth scenarios for skill building. Later targets increase difficulty with complex patrol patterns and awareness. Learning each target's behavior is key to efficient collection.

## Advanced Mechanics

### Pattern Recognition

Experienced players memorize target behavior cycles. Sleep patterns, movement routines, and awareness triggers become predictable. Pattern knowledge enables precise timing for approaches and extractions. Mastery allows speedrun optimization and perfect runs.

### Risk Assessment

Every extraction attempt involves calculated risk. Some targets are inherently more difficult than others. Environmental factors affect stealth difficulty. Current player skill level determines success probability.

Smart players evaluate situations before committing. They retreat from high-risk scenarios to try later. They build confidence with easier targets first. They develop judgment for when to push forward or fall back.

### Stress Management

The game's horror atmosphere creates psychological pressure on players. Time pressure compounds stress during extractions. Failed attempts generate frustration that affects performance. Learning to stay calm under pressure is essential for mastery.

Successful players develop mental resilience through practice. They accept failures as learning opportunities. They maintain focus despite the creepy atmosphere. They cultivate patience for perfect timing execution.

The interlocking mechanics of stealth, extraction timing, time pressure, and collection management create The Tooth Fae's unique gameplay experience. Understanding these systems transforms you from a novice collector into a master tooth fae who executes flawless extractions with surgical precision.
