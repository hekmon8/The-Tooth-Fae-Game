# How to Play The Tooth Fae

## Quick Start Guide

[Play The Tooth Fae online free](https://playthetoothfae.com/games/tooth-fae) directly in your browser or download the Windows version from itch.io. The game puts you in the role of a mysterious tooth-collecting entity navigating homes to extract teeth from sleeping creatures while following strict survival rules.

For the optimal horror experience, enable fullscreen mode and sound. Headphones are recommended for better atmospheric immersion. Safari users should disable low power mode to prevent performance throttling.

## The Four Cardinal Rules

### Rule 1: Preparation is Required
Pulling teeth requires preparation, otherwise a thing may die. You cannot immediately extract teeth - you must complete preparation steps first. Rushing leads to target death and mission failure. This is the foundation of the extraction process.

### Rule 2: Watch for the Bleeding Signal
A tooth that bleeds is ripe for plucking. Wait for the visual bleeding indicator that signals the tooth is ready for extraction. Attempting extraction before bleeding appears will fail. This is your most critical visual cue.

### Rule 3: Time Management
Don't dally. Even such a thing as a fright might be too much for them. Time is limited for each extraction, and targets are fragile creatures that can die from stress. Balance caution with efficiency and don't linger unnecessarily.

### Rule 4: Absolute Stealth
**YOU MUST NEVER BE SEEN.** Detection means instant failure. Stay hidden at all times, use environmental cover, and monitor target awareness levels. This rule is non-negotiable - one sighting ends your collection mission.

## Game Flow

The collection process follows a structured sequence that you'll master with practice:

**Town Screen**: View your collection progress and select your next target location. Warning: hitting the back button will clear your collection progress, so use in-game navigation only.

**Approach Phase**: Navigate to the target location, identify the sleeping creature, plan your approach carefully, and ensure the target is in the proper state before proceeding.

**Preparation Phase**: Begin the tooth extraction process, monitor preparation progress, watch for visual indicators, and stay undetected during preparation.

**Extraction Phase**: Wait for the bleeding indicator to appear, execute extraction immediately when ready, complete quickly to avoid target stress, and maintain stealth throughout the entire process.

**Collection Phase**: Successfully extracted teeth are added to your collection. Return to the town screen to choose your next target or review your progress.

## Essential Tips for New Players

Start slow on your first playthrough. Take time to learn the mechanics and don't rush - failures are part of the learning process. Each attempt teaches you something valuable about timing, stealth, and target behavior.

Always play with sound enabled. Audio cues are essential for gameplay success and provide crucial information about target awareness and game states. Environmental sounds and music changes signal important events.

Master the basics before attempting advanced techniques. Understand all four cardinal rules, practice stealth navigation, learn to recognize the bleeding indicator instantly, and get comfortable with your chosen input method.

Avoid the back button on the town screen at all costs. This will erase all your collection progress. Use in-game navigation only and be deliberate with all inputs.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Rushing the Extraction**: Attempting extraction before preparation is complete results in target death and mission failure. Always wait for the bleeding indicator to appear before proceeding.

**Ignoring Stealth**: Getting detected by targets means instant failure. Always prioritize stealth, even if it takes longer. Patience is essential for success.

**Poor Time Management**: Taking too long during extraction causes targets to die from stress and fright. Be efficient once preparation is complete and execute immediately when ready.

**Playing Without Sound**: Missing crucial audio cues makes gameplay significantly harder and causes you to miss important warnings. Sound is not optional for optimal play.

The average playthrough takes about 30 minutes, making it perfect for quick gaming sessions. The game offers high replayability with multiple strategies and approaches.
