## Core Gameplay

### The Objective

Your goal is to collect teeth from fragile creatures while following strict rules to prevent their death and avoid detection. Each successful extraction adds to your collection.

### The Four Cardinal Rules

#### Rule 1: Preparation is Required
> *"Pulling teeth requires preparation, otherwise a thing may die."*

- You cannot immediately extract teeth
- Must complete preparation steps first
- Rushing leads to target death and mission failure

#### Rule 2: Watch for the Bleeding Signal
> *"A tooth that bleeds is ripe for plucking."*

- Wait for the visual bleeding indicator
- This signals the tooth is ready for extraction
- Attempting extraction before bleeding appears will fail

#### Rule 3: Time Management
> *"Don't dally. Even such a thing as a fright might be too much for them."*

- Time is limited for each extraction
- Targets are fragile and can die from stress
- Balance caution with efficiency
- Don't linger unnecessarily

#### Rule 4: Absolute Stealth
> *"**YOU MUST NEVER BE SEEN.**"*

- Detection means instant failure
- Stay hidden at all times
- Use environmental cover
- Monitor target awareness levels

## Game Flow

### 3. Preparation Phase

### 4. Extraction Phase

- Complete sessions to secure progress
- Take mental notes of collection status

### Efficiency Tips

**Route Planning**
- Plan efficient paths between targets
- Minimize backtracking
- Group nearby targets when possible

**Pattern Recognition**
- Learn target behavior patterns
- Identify optimal extraction windows
- Develop muscle memory for extraction process

**Stress Management**
- Stay calm under time pressure
- Don't panic if situations become tense
- Methodical approach beats rushing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Rushing the Extraction
- **Problem**: Attempting extraction before preparation complete
- **Result**: Target dies, mission fails
- **Solution**: Wait for bleeding indicator

### ❌ Ignoring Stealth
- **Problem**: Getting detected by targets
- **Result**: Instant failure
- **Solution**: Always prioritize stealth, even if it takes longer

### ❌ Poor Time Management
- **Problem**: Taking too long during extraction
- **Result**: Target dies from stress/fright
- **Solution**: Be efficient once preparation is complete

### ❌ Using Back Button
- **Problem**: Accidentally hitting back on town screen
- **Result**: All collection progress erased
- **Solution**: Avoid back button, use in-game navigation

### ❌ Playing Without Sound
- **Problem**: Missing crucial audio cues
- **Result**: Harder gameplay, missed warnings
- **Solution**: Always play with sound enabled

## Troubleshooting
